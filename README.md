# Portfolio-risk-return

Repository for codes related to finding the return and risk of securities and portfolios, mean-variance optimization and implementing the Capital Asset Pricing Model in Python.

Contents:

1. <strong> return-risk-single </strong>- To calculate the annual return and volatility of a single stock and basic visualizations.
2.  <strong> return-risk-portfolio  </strong> - To calculate the annual return, volatility, diversifiable risk of a portfolio of stocks. Also includes a comparison with a stock index (S&P500)
3.  <strong> ef-2-assets  </strong>- To calculate the return and volatility of random portfolios containing two risky assets, to plot them and visually identify the efficient frontier
4.  <strong> mvo-portfolio-risky  </strong> - To calculate the return and volatility of a portfolio containing many risky assets, to plot them and to rigorously calculate the efficient frontier using a mean variance optimizer function.
5.  <strong> two-fund-theorem  </strong>- To calculate the return and volatility of a portfolio containing many risky assets and one riskfree asset. Here we also demonstrate the two-fund theorem
6.  <strong> beta-linreg  </strong> - To calculate the beta of a stock using linear regression in Python
